Write a program that implements the disk-scheduling algorithms that is not implemented in hw4:
            a. FCFS
            b. SSTF
            c. SCAN
            d. C-SCAN
            e. LOOK
            f. C-LOOK
Your program will service a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0-4,999.
The program will generate a random series of 1,000 requests and service them according to three of the
algorithms listed above. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head as a parameter. On the command line and report the total amount of head movement by each algorithm. 

Note: we already implement b. SSTF, c. SCAN, d. C-SCAN in HW#, so we will work with the following:
            a. FCFS
            e. LOOK
            f. C-LOOK
