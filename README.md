Programming Assignment #4
Programming Problem 10.24 (Page 501)
Write a program the implements 3 of the following disk-scheduling algorithms:

FCFS
SSTF
SCAN
C-SCAN
LOOK
C-LOOK
Your program will service a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0-4,999.
The program will generate a random series of 1,000 requests and service them according to three of the
algorithms listed above. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head as a parameter
on the command line and report the total amount of head movement by each algorithm.
